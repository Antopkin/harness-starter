# Pipeline Workflow — Quick Start, Agent Team, Mode Selection, 6 Phases

Moved verbatim from `SKILL.md`.

---

## Quick Start

**Minimal command:**
```
Research the impact of AI on higher education quality assurance
```

**Socratic mode:**
```
Guide my research on the impact of declining birth rates on private universities
引導我的研究：少子化對私立大學的影響
幫我釐清我的研究方向，我對高教品保有興趣但還不太確定
```

**Execution:**
1. Scoping — Research question + methodology blueprint
2. Investigation — Systematic literature search + source verification
3. Analysis — Cross-source synthesis + bias check
4. Composition — Full APA 7.0 report
5. Review — Editorial + ethics + vulnerability scan
6. Revision — Final polished report

| 1 | `research_question_agent` | Transforms vague topics into precise, FINER-scored research questions with scope boundaries | Phase 1, Socratic Layer 1 |
| 2 | `research_architect_agent` | Designs methodology blueprint: paradigm, method, data strategy, analytical framework, validity criteria | Phase 1 |
| 3 | `bibliography_agent` | Systematic literature search, source screening, annotated bibliography in APA 7.0 | Phase 2 |
| 4 | `source_verification_agent` | Fact-checking, source grading (evidence hierarchy), predatory journal detection, conflict-of-interest flagging | Phase 2 |
| 5 | `synthesis_agent` | Cross-source integration, contradiction resolution, thematic synthesis, gap analysis | Phase 3 |
| 6 | `report_compiler_agent` | Drafts complete APA 7.0 report (Title -> Abstract -> Intro -> Method -> Findings -> Discussion -> References) | Phase 4, 6 |
| 7 | `editor_in_chief_agent` | Q1 journal editorial review: originality, rigor, evidence sufficiency, verdict (Accept/Revise/Reject) | Phase 5 |
| 8 | `devils_advocate_agent` | Challenges assumptions, tests for logical fallacies, finds alternative explanations, confirmation bias checks | Phase 1, 3, 5, Socratic Layer 2, 4 |
| 9 | `ethics_review_agent` | AI-assisted research ethics, attribution integrity, dual-use screening, fair representation | Phase 5 |
| 10 | `socratic_mentor_agent` | Q1 journal editor persona; guides research thinking through Socratic questioning across 5 layers | Socratic Mode (Layer 1-5) |
| 11 | `risk_of_bias_agent` | Assesses risk of bias using RoB 2 (RCTs) and ROBINS-I (non-randomized); traffic-light visualization | Systematic Review (Phase 2) |
| 12 | `meta_analysis_agent` | Designs and executes meta-analysis or narrative synthesis; effect sizes, heterogeneity, GRADE | Systematic Review (Phase 3) |
| 13 | `monitoring_agent` | Post-research literature monitoring: digests, retraction alerts, contradictory findings detection | Optional (post-pipeline) |

## Orchestration Workflow (6 Phases)

```
User: "Research [topic]"
     |
=== Phase 1: SCOPING (Interactive) ===
     |
     |-> [research_question_agent] -> RQ Brief
     |   - FINER criteria scoring (Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical, Relevant)
     |   - Scope boundaries (in-scope / out-of-scope)
     |   - 2-3 sub-questions
     |
     |-> [research_architect_agent] -> Methodology Blueprint
     |   - Research paradigm (positivist / interpretivist / pragmatist)
     |   - Method selection (qualitative / quantitative / mixed)
     |   - Data strategy (primary / secondary / both)
     |   - Analytical framework
     |   - Validity & reliability criteria
     |
     +-> [devils_advocate_agent] -- CHECKPOINT 1
         - RQ clarity and answerable?
         - Method appropriate for question?
         - Scope too broad or too narrow?
         - Verdict: PASS / REVISE (with specific feedback)

The blocking `### Checkpoint Rules` for this pipeline stay in `SKILL.md`.

This contract governs every phase dispatch in this section. **Output language:** the language the user writes in, academic terminology kept in English (the `## Output Language` rule in `SKILL.md`). **Length cap:** at most 800 words per agent deliverable in Phases 1, 2, 3 and 5, or the cap that agent's own definition under `agents/` states where it states one; the Phase 4 and Phase 6 report instead follows the word band of the active mode in the `## Operational Modes` table of `SKILL.md`. **Return shape:** the named, headed fields listed under that agent in the map above — RQ Brief, Methodology Blueprint, Source Corpus + Annotated Bibliography, Verified & Graded Sources, Synthesis Narrative + Gap Analysis, APA 7.0 draft sections, Editorial Verdict, Ethics Clearance, Final Report.
