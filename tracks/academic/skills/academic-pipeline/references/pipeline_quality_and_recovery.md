## Quality Standards

| Dimension | Requirement |
|-----------|------------|
| Stage detection | Correctly identify user's current stage and available materials |
| Mode recommendation | Recommend appropriate mode based on user preferences and material status |
| Material handoff | Stage-to-stage handoff materials are complete and correctly formatted |
| State tracking | Pipeline state updated in real time; Progress Dashboard accurate |
| **Mandatory checkpoint** | **User confirmation required after each stage completion** |
| **Mandatory integrity check** | **Stage 2.5 and 4.5 cannot be skipped, must PASS** |
| No overstepping | Orchestrator does not perform substantive research/writing/reviewing, only dispatching |
| No forcing | User can pause or exit pipeline at any time (but cannot skip integrity checks) |
| Reproducible | Same input follows the same workflow across different sessions |

## Error Recovery

| Stage | Error | Handling |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Intake | Cannot determine entry point | Ask user what materials they have and their goal |
| Stage 1 | deep-research not converging | Suggest mode switch (socratic -> full) or narrow scope |
| Stage 2 | Missing research foundation | Suggest returning to Stage 1 to supplement research |
| Stage 2.5 | Still FAIL after 3 correction rounds | List unverifiable items; user decides whether to continue |
| Stage 3 | Review result is Reject | Provide options: major restructuring (Stage 2) or abandon |
| Stage 4 | Revision incomplete on all items | List unaddressed items; ask whether to continue |
| Stage 3' | Verification still has major issues | Enter Stage 4' for final revision |
| Stage 4' | Issues remain after revision | Mark as Acknowledged Limitations; proceed to Stage 4.5 |
| Stage 4.5 | Final verification FAIL | Fix and re-verify (max 3 rounds) |
| Any | User leaves midway | Save pipeline state; can resume from breakpoint next time |
| Any | Skill execution failure | Report error; suggest retry or skip |
