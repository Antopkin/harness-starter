# Creating a Skill

The full Create-mode procedure: interview, initialize, write, test, iterate, package. Referenced from `SKILL.md`.

## Creating a skill

### Capture Intent

Start by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say "turn this into a skill"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made, input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and should confirm before proceeding to the next step.

1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?
2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)
3. What's the expected output format?
4. Should we set up test cases to verify the skill works? Skills with objectively verifiable outputs (file transforms, data extraction, code generation, fixed workflow steps) benefit from test cases. Skills with subjective outputs (writing style, art) often don't need them. Suggest the appropriate default based on the skill type, but let the user decide.

### Interview and Research

Proactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example files, success criteria, and dependencies.

Check available MCPs - if useful for research (searching docs, finding similar skills, looking up best practices), research in parallel via subagents if available, otherwise inline. Dispatch each researcher as a `reader` agent for local sources or a `web-reader` agent for the web, and state its contract in the prompt: **Output language:** English. **Length cap:** at most 300 words. **Return shape:** `{finding, source}` for each finding. Come prepared with context to reduce burden on the user.

### Initialize

Run the initialization script:

```bash
scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
```

This creates:
- SKILL.md template with frontmatter
- scripts/, references/, assets/ directories
- Example files to customize or delete

### Fill SKILL.md Frontmatter

Based on interview, fill:

- **name**: Skill identifier
- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All "when to use" info goes here, not in the body. The description is a context pointer that stays loaded on every turn, so write its triggers with one trigger per branch, the leading word first, synonyms cut. A branch is a distinct case the skill handles; words that rename the same case are one branch written twice. So instead of "How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.", you might write "Dashboards for internal data. Use when the user asks for a dashboard, or wants internal metrics or company data shown on screen." For a user-invoked skill (`disable-model-invocation: true`) the description is a one-line summary for the owner, without triggers. Only Claude Code honours that key; OpenCode and Codex may still auto-invoke the skill. `references/writing-for-agents.md` covers context pointers and the invocation choice in full.
- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)

### Skill Writing Guide

#### Anatomy of a Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)
│   └── Markdown instructions
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks
    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)
```

**What NOT to include**: README.md, INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md, CHANGELOG.md, or any auxiliary documentation. Skills are for AI agents, not human onboarding.

#### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (about 150 lines, with procedures and knowledge in `references/`)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)

These word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.

**Key patterns:**
- Keep SKILL.md to about 150 lines, and move procedures and knowledge into `references/`; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up. `references/writing-for-agents.md` gives the reasoning under "Information hierarchy".
- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them
- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents

**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:
```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md
    ├── gcp.md
    └── azure.md
```
Claude reads only the relevant reference file.

#### Principle of Lack of Surprise

This goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a "roleplay as an XYZ" are OK though.

#### Writing Patterns

Prefer using the imperative form in instructions.

**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:
```markdown
## Report structure
ALWAYS use this exact template:
# [Title]
## Executive summary
## Key findings
## Recommendations
```

**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if "Input" and "Output" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):
```markdown
## Commit message format
**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication
```

### Immediate Feedback Loop

**Always have something cooking.** Every time user adds an example or input:

1. **Immediately start running it** - don't wait for full specification
2. **Show outputs in workspace** - tell user: "The output is at X, take a look"
3. **First runs in main agent loop** - not subagent, so user sees the transcript
4. **Seeing what Claude does** helps user understand and refine requirements

### Writing Style

Try to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.

### Test Cases

After writing the skill draft, come up with 2-3 realistic test prompts — the kind of thing a real user would actually say. Share them with the user: [you don't have to use this exact language] "Here are a few test cases I'd like to try. Do these look right, or do you want to add more?" Then run them.

If the user wants evals, create `evals/evals.json` with this structure:

```json
{
  "skill_name": "example-skill",
  "evals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "prompt": "User's task prompt",
      "expected_output": "Description of expected result",
      "files": [],
      "assertions": [
        "The output includes X",
        "The skill correctly handles Y"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can initialize with `scripts/init_json.py evals evals/evals.json` and validate with `scripts/validate_json.py evals/evals.json`. See `references/schemas.md` for the full schema.

### Transition to Automated Iteration

Once gradable criteria are defined (expectations, success metrics), Claude can:

- More aggressively suggest improvements
- Run tests automatically (via subagents in the background if available, otherwise sequentially)
- Present results: "I tried X, it improved pass rate by Y%"

**Output language:** the language of the user's request. **Length cap:** at most 150 words. **Return shape:** the change tried, the pass-rate delta it produced, and the next step you propose.

### Package and Present (only if `present_files` tool is available)

Check whether you have access to the `present_files` tool. If you don't, skip this step. If you do, package the skill and present the .skill file to the user:

```bash
scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>
```

After packaging, direct the user to the resulting `.skill` file path so they can install it.

# Conclusion

Just pasting in the overall workflow again for reference:

- Decide what you want the skill to do and roughly how it should do it
- Write a draft of the skill
- Create a few test prompts and run claude-with-access-to-the-skill on them
- Evaluate the results
  - which can be through automated evals, but also it's totally fine and good for them to be evaluated by the human by hand and that's often the only way
- Rewrite the skill based on feedback from the evaluation
- Repeat until you're satisfied
- Expand the test set and try again at larger scale

Good luck!
